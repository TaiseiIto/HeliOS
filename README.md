# HeliOS

This is my original operating system running on x64 architecture.

## Development environment

HeliOS is developed on a Docker container provided by [.docker](.docker) directory.
You can build and enter a development environment like below.

```
/somewhere $ git clone https://github.com/TaiseiIto/HeliOS.git
/somewhere $ cd HeliOS
/somewhere/HeliOS $ make environment
~/HeliOS #
```
Now you are in the development environment!
